This summer, our team had an intern, and one question that she asked has stuck with me for a while: "Is AI going to replace frontend jobs?" I found myself thinking deeply about this question because it came from someone not yet fully immersed in the industry but trying to find their footing in the software development world. This question has been circulating extensively in the past year since AI-assisted coding took off, but hearing it from a newcomer gave it a different weight.

## My AI Journey

Looking back at my experience with AI tools, I can trace my first significant encounter to the [GitHub Copilot Technical Preview](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer) back in 2021. I recall seeing it being discussed by tech influencers on Twitter and watching demos on YouTube. I was genuinely excited to try it out and was fortunate enough to get access shortly after its announcement.

Playing around with GitHub Copilot back then feels pretty primitive compared to the AI tools I use today with their agentic workflows and conversational interfaces. Back then, it was straightforward: add a comment to describe a function you wanted to generate, and it would create it for you. My personal lightbulb moment came with test generation. I've never been the biggest fan of writing tests (even today), but writing a comment asking Copilot to generate a test and having it work correctly felt like pure magic.

At that point, I wasn't particularly familiar with LLMs or OpenAI as concepts. It's worth remembering that this was July 2021, over a year before ChatGPT entered the mainstream and transformed our understanding of AI capabilities. I simply accepted it at face value, assuming it had been trained on StackOverflow answers and GitHub repositories.

## The Rapid Evolution

Between the initial release and what we see now, there was [GitHub Copilot Labs](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-labs) which in my mind introduced the primitive building blocks of what we now know as the agentic editing experience. It was an important step that gave Copilot the ability to reason and transform code versus just providing plain AI autocomplete, which is what I'd classify the original release of Copilot as doing. This was the beginning of AI tools having more agency in the development process.

At the same time the Technical Preview was ending, I joined Microsoft and got access to GitHub Copilot in it's entirety as it was transitioning to the subscription model. The progression from there to [GitHub Copilot X](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience) which seemed heavily inspired by ChatGPT's overnight success allowed me to converse directly with the AI from within VS Code rather than just generating code from annotated comments.

In the last year, i've seen yet another leap with agentic modes in tools like Cursor, Cline, and GitHub Copilot. Looking back over these past four years, it's been a whirlwind journey watching how rapidly things have changed in the industry. I feel fortunate to have witnessed this evolution from early on, and being at Microsoft during this period was advantageous as I had access to cutting-edge tools and LLM models to experiment with as soon as they became available.

## Where AI Shines in Development

As a whole, I've found AI tools particularly good at scaffolding projects. I sometimes struggle with or procrastinate on starting something because I aim for some level of perfection from the beginning, which leads me to second-guess even getting something quick and dirty up and running. AI tools help overcome that initial hurdle. I use AI to do that initial legwork, which gets ideas flowing, and then I typically rewrite parts and refine them to match my vision. I like making things my way.

In more complex coding situations, AI isn't yet capable of handling everything in a one-shot prompt manner. Maybe I need to fine-tune my prompts (or become a better "prompt engineer," as they say). But for many mundane tasks, it really shines, like generating scripts to automate repetitive work. I understand how to read and interpret what a PowerShell or Bash script does, but if you asked me to write something from scratch, I'd struggle. That's where AI comes in; I explain what I need through natural language, and it gets me most of the way there.

## Will AI Replace Frontend Development?

Circling back to the intern's question, I did respond that yes, it is possible that AI could replace some frontend engineering jobs. I'm not discounting that possibility. However, with software development, especially enterprise development, it's not always just about getting things to work. Which is what AI is great for.

A perfect example is with frontend styling changes. When addressing a visual bug, AI tends to pile on CSS to "fix" the issue. Yes, it solves the immediate problem, but when I evaluate the solution, I often realize we could just apply an API property from our component library to fix it more elegantly. These maintainability considerations are crucial in the lifecycle of a software product.

It might be cheaper and faster to have AI build a working model, but supporting and maintaining it long-term is something I believe AI agents aren't equipped to handle yet. They will probably get there eventually with larger context windows, but that's one of the nuances when discussing whether AI will replace human developers.

## Where AI Truly Excels

Like a lot of us these days, using AI is like a non negotiable trait and it's becoming essential to and sometimes feels like a "lifehack" to do something that bit faster. Here's a few things that I feel it's amazing at

### Creating Analogies and Translations

AI is really good at coming up with analogies that make complex concepts understandable. Many times, I'm trying to explain technical concepts to non-technical leaders or friends outside the tech sphere, and AI helps simplify these explanations with apt analogies. It's like having a reddit eli5 (explain like i'm 5) thread already created with some great answers.

I've also found it helpful with concepts from self-help books. I'm somewhat of a fan of self-help literature in recent years, and AI has been excellent at giving me examples of how to apply theoretical concepts in practical situations. Recently, I was recommended "Loving What Is" by Byron Katie, and I used AI to help understand and apply her framework to real-life scenarios.

### Knowledge Expansion

I'm a naturally curious person, and when I watch documentaries or read about something interesting, I tend to fall down rabbit holes of information. AI simplifies this process by connecting different dots and providing a broader context.

During my recent trip to Osaka and Seoul, I visited Osaka Castle and learned that the person who built it was the same historical figure portrayed in FX's "Shogun" series (which is excellent, by the way, 10/10 would recommend). Later, at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the tour guide mentioned how the current palace was mostly rebuilt after the Japanese invasion. After the tour, I went on a questioning spree with ChatGPT to dig deeper and connect these historical events, which gave me a comprehensive understanding of how these seemingly separate pieces of history were interrelated.

### Trip Planning

On my recent trip to Japan and Korea, I noticed everyday people using tools like ChatGPT on their phones while navigating public transit, not just once or twice, but consistently throughout my travels. And I completely understand why.

These AI tools were instrumental in my trip planning. Depending on the day and what attractions or restaurants I wanted to visit, ChatGPT and Gemini effectively created and revised itineraries on the fly. They accounted for walking time, opening hours, ticket prices, and even suggested adjacent attractions I might enjoy.

While I could have done this planning myself on a computer before the trip, being able to make changes on my phone based on weather conditions or if we wanted a more relaxed day was a game-changer. Of course, throughout this process, I did wonder if these platforms might eventually become vehicles for targeted advertising based on our travel preferences and queries.

## If you can dream it, you can build it

As I reflect on my experiences with AI tools over these past few years, I see them not as replacements for human creativity and judgment but as powerful augmentations to our capabilities. They remove friction from the creative process, handle routine tasks that would otherwise drain our energy, and serve as thought partners when exploring new ideas.

The question isn't whether AI will replace us, but how we can best work alongside it to enhance what we do. For me, that means using AI to overcome initial hurdles, to explain complex ideas simply, to explore knowledge more efficiently, and to manage logistical details that would otherwise consume my time and attention.

In the end, the most powerful combination isn't AI alone or human alone, it's the thoughtful collaboration between the two.
