# Welcome to TinaCMS

This is my first blog post using **TinaCMS** as the content management system. 

## Features I love about TinaCMS

- **Git-based workflow**: All content is stored in Git
- **Real-time editing**: Edit content and see changes instantly
- **Developer-friendly**: Built with developers in mind
- **Open source**: Free and open source

## Getting Started

Setting up TinaCMS was straightforward:

1. Install the necessary packages
2. Configure the schema
3. Set up the admin interface
4. Start creating content!

I'm excited to start blogging with this new setup. The editing experience feels much more modern and developer-friendly compared to traditional CMSs.
